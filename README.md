# IMPACT Dementia (Peru)

<h3 align="center">IMPACT: Innovations using Mhealth for People with dementiA
and Co-morbidiTies  </h3>


 The system has a Django installation used for authentication, user management and (eventually) as the basis for a CMS (for the public website). Django provides a Model-View-Controller framework for the different views to access the research data. 
Two views are currently being developed: 
  
- [IMPACT app](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/IMPACT-dementia/blob/main/impact/README.md): to be used by community health workers to collect data
  
- Ana: a chatbot to provide support to clients (PLWD and families)

- [Notas](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/IMPACT-dementia/blob/main/backend/notas/README.md): a small demo app

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This is the source code repository for the IMPACT project. The project is described here:
```
L√∫car, Miriam G., et al. ‚ÄòPeru Initiates the IMPACT Project‚Äô. The Lancet Neurology, vol. 22, no. 8, Aug. 2023, p. 653. ScienceDirect, https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(23)00239-9
```

## üßê Vision <a name = "vision"></a>
Health problems across LMIC can be addressed with the participation of local community healthcare workers (CHW), often volunteers with little training, but lots of connection to the communities they are helping.

Beyond the IMPACT project we would like this software to support the connection between CHW and patients and carers.


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.



## üîßRunning tests <a name = "tests"></a>



## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
###  Startup Data
 Find here a description of the default data model for user groups. The data is in fixtures folder

### üîß Starting dev server <a name = "tests"></a>
To start a server with preloaded data, to be used for development

Create DB
```
cd backend 
createdb impact-db
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Start server
```
python manage.py runserver  
```
Rest the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/?next=/admin/
