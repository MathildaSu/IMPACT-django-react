# IMPACT Dementia (Peru)

<h3 align="center">IMPACT: Innovations using Mhealth for People with dementiA
and Co-morbidiTies  </h3>


 The system has a Django installation used for authentication, user management and (eventually) as the basis for a CMS (for the public website). Django provides a Model-View-Controller framework for the different views to access the research data. 
Two views are currently being developed: 
  
- [IMPACT app](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/IMPACT-dementia/blob/main/impact/README.md): to be used by community health workers to collect data
  
- Ana: a chatbot to provide support to clients (PLWD and families)

- [Notas](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/IMPACT-dementia/blob/main/backend/notas/README.md): a small demo app
